                    <p>Hello, I am Xuexin, like to draw and record the moments of life with colors and lines. For me, painting is not only a way of expression, but also a way to relax. In the future, I hope to have a kitten (to be best, I want to have a Sanhua, a kind of cute cat that looks like in the image) to accompany myself and spend warm and fun time together.</p>
